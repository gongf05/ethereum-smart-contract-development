### challenge: try to hack deployed contract and withdraw ETH fund!

```solidity
function withdrawFund(address dst) onlyAuthorized external returns (bool) {
        require(now > nextWithdrawTime);
        assert(withdrawObserver.call(bytes4(sha3("observe()"))));
        bool res = basicWithdraw(dst);
        nextWithdrawTime = nextWithdrawTime + withdrawCoolDownTime;
        return res;
    }
```
